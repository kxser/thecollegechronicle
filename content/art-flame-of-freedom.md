Rising with freedom's flame, 

Echoes of Atatürk's name, 

Published in every newspaper, 

United, we proudly stand. 

Battled our way through the war, 

Liberty guiding each step, 

Independence etched in history's pages, 

Citizens guarding every step, 

Dancing and singing all around, 

A day to remember is born. 

Youth now holds that sacred flame, 

The Republic, in freedom's name.
