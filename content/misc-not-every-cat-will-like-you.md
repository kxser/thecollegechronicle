I don’t like spicy food. I don’t know why I don’t like them, I just don’t. Maybe I just don’t like how they act, how they speak, or how they walk. Sometimes even little things make me mad when I’m overstimulated, you know? But those spicy ones always want me to like them. They always force me to eat them, they insist. They are always trying to talk to me, they always make jokes to make me laugh. I don’t find them funny. I hate their sense of humor. The worst thing is that they get sad because I don’t like them, and that makes me feel bad. Should I like everything? Why do some foods want everyone to eat them with appetite? Everyone’s tastes are different, and you can’t make everyone love you. Life has some negatives. They are still someone’s favorite even if I hate them, they still matter. My mom likes them. She thinks that they are cool and living their teenage life with joy. Her friends like them too. They always laugh at their jokes, and they always burst out laughing. But do you know someone even my mom dislikes? Eggplants. She thinks the opposite of them, that they are a bad influence on me. I don’t really like them either. They act weird in my opinion. They shout while they swing on the seesaw. Their word choices are weird, and they watch TV while doing a handstand. But my friend, who is an orange street cat, loves them. She always calls them over to play with us. She likes the way they shout with excitement while they are on the seesaw. She likes the way they speak, the kindness in their hearts. She likes the way they dress, the way they have DIY studs all over their clothes. They matter to her. She hates that they are always left out because “no one likes them.” She hates social standards. She likes the ones that are “unloved.” She thinks that everyone has habits that someone will absolutely love.

She doesn’t like sweets that much, but I love them.
