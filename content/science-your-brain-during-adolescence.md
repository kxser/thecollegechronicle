You might have realized a shift in your behaviour in recent years. This is mainly because of adolescence. This is probably the weirdest era in your life. You always change your ideas, get motivated and suddenly lose it, or act distant to others. Whatever it is, this is because of the changes in your brain and body. And today, we will look deeper into what is happening in your brain.

During adolescence, a teenager’s brain goes through major changes that affect how they think, feel, and behave. One of the most important changes happens in a place called the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that is responsible for self-control. This area’s development fastens, which means teenagers may act impulsive or have difficulty thinking. Moreover, the brain starts to cut unused neural connections and strengthens the ones that are used often. This makes the brain work more efficiently.

Another major change occurs in the limbic system, which is responsible for controlling emotions and the brain’s reward system. During adolescence, this system develops faster than the prefrontal cortex, causing stronger emotions and harsh reactions. Teenagers experience mood swings, sensitive behaviour and a desire to be socially accepted. Hormonal changes during puberty also happen in the brain, increasing curiosity and risk-taking behaviour. For example, the dopamine hormone which is responsible for making us feel motivated and happy (serotonin too), goes through significant reorganization. This causes mood swings and unexpected behaviour.

These changes are completely normal and shows that you are healthy. The developing teenage brain is learning how to adapt, become independent, and prepare for adulthood. While adolescence can be challenging, the brain’s flexibility during this time allows teenagers to learn quickly and develop their identity. With time, the brain matures, showing that these changes are a natural and important stage of human development.
