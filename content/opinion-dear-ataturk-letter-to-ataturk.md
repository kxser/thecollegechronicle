It has been 102 years of freedom, a legacy made possible by your leadership and courage. It is such an honor to have had you as our first President. You are the one who brightened our lives by declaring the Republic. You are the father of future generations, and we will never let them forget you.

By transforming the monarchy into a republic, you crowned the Turkish nation's struggle for independence. The Republic means the people's right to determine their own future. It stands for freedom, equality, and democracy. We will always remember your vision and carry your principles in our hearts.

With endless respect and gratitude, the children of the republic.
