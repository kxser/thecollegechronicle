The unforgettable 76th Formula 1 World Championship has come to an end at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, delivering one of the most breathtaking battles in recent years. Lando Norris became the 2025 world champion, finishing third in the final race but securing the title by just two points ahead of Max Verstappen. With this result, Verstappen's four-year championship streak came to an end.

One of the most exciting facts of this season was the three-way title fight among three drivers. Alongside Norris, his teammate in McLaren, Oscar Piastri remained a strong title-fighter until the final races. Piastri finished the season in third place and proved through his performance that he is one of the sport's future stars. Piastri, who's still early in his Formula 1 career, has quickly become one of the sport’s most exciting young talents. He made his Formula 1 debut with McLaren in 2023 after graduating from junior categories (Formula 2). In the 2025 season, Piastri scored 7 Grand Prix wins and 16 podiums, and even led the championship for more races than anyone else, though he ultimately finished third overall. He’s widely seen as a future world champion if he continues developing with a top car.

On the other side, Max Verstappen has already been a force in Formula 1 for many years. He debuted in 2015 and quickly became one of the youngest winners in history. Verstappen has collected over 70 Grand Prix victories and multiple world titles with Red Bull Racing, making him one of the most successful drivers ever. Even in 2025, he won the most races of the season and pushed hard until the very end of the title fight, finishing the race being the winner.

Finally, the champion Lando Norris finished off his seven seasons in Formula 1 by winning his first world championship in 2025 with McLaren. He made his debut in 2019 and steadily climbed the ranks, scoring 11 career Grands Prix wins and many podiums along the way. His 2025 title came after a dramatic battle with both Piastri and Verstappen, proving his growth into a true championship winner.

Overall, the 2025 Formula 1 season was one of the most gripping seasons in recent history. With three drivers fighting for the title, every race weekend felt unpredictable and intense. Fans stayed glued to their screens as small details, strategy calls, safety cars, and even single overtakes had the power to change the championship standings. In the end, the season didn’t just crown a champion, it reminded everyone why Formula 1 is one of the most exciting sports in the world.
