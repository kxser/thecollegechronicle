Free and open-source software, known better by its abbreviation FOSS, is software that is free to run, study, change, and share. Such freedom is enshrined in open-source licenses like the MIT and Apache software licenses. The idea of FOSS is not just legal, it is also social, since communities of volunteers and companies with the same end-goal get to work together in a collaborative and harmonious way. A few well-known examples of FOSS software are Linux, Firefox, Blender, and Chromium.

Cost is the first benefit most people notice. Many proprietary tools charge per user or per device, which adds up quickly and adds authentication (ownership-verification) overhead. With FOSS, you can install the same program on ten or ten million machines without new license fees, and most of the time, get a better experience throughout the whole process. The shift to entirely free software matters a lot for schools, startups and public agencies that need modern tooling but are scrutinized heavily on every expense. FOSS also reduces the risk of vendor lock-in, since there are no restrictive technologies in it by design. 

Security and quality are often stronger with open code because anyone can review how a feature works and propose a fix. Vulnerabilities are not addressed in the shadows; they are visible, discussed, and fixed in the public view. This doesn't mean all projects are automatically safer, but it does allow a quick and verifiable response if a security breach does occur. The process encourages small, modular, hot-swappable parts that can be tested rigorously. This lowers the chance that a single issue collapses the whole system. Frequent releases and active issue trackers give teams an early warning system. Over time, that transparency builds trust, since overarching claims about software are more up to scrutiny. 

FOSS is also a natural fit for learning and research. Students can read real production code, trace a feature from design to merge, and practice contribution through best practices. In universities and labs, open tools make it easier to reproduce results and benefit too. Even the smallest establishments can start with proven open components and customize them for their niche. The habit of contributing to open source projects creates a talent pipeline, because new developers can show concrete contributions rather than only listing skills.

There are strong business reasons to adopt FOSS even if you never plan to write a line of code. Service models around installation, integration, hosting, and support are well established, so you can buy reliability without giving up control. The practical path to get started is simple. Pick a mature project with active maintainers, try it on a real problem, and join discussion channels where users and developers meet. When you outgrow a default feature, file an issue, sponsor an enhancement, or contract a developer to extend it.  The more you participate, the more you benefit, and the healthier the software becomes for anyone who decides to rely on it as well.
