Cheers to Republic Day! I usually wonder what you would think of us now: teens with phones, social media, and bigger objectives. Your vision continues to inspire us to value freedom, think for ourselves, and dream big in today's fast and noisy world.

I love to spend time with my grandparents, watching the ceremonies at historical places and feeling proud of the nation you stood up for every October 29. Republic Day is more than just an annual celebration; it is a reminder that we young people have the ability to influence the future of history.

Your vision of a powerful, imaginative, and innovative Türkiye inspires us to take action, be creative, and change the world. I appreciate everything you've done.
