Have you ever researched what other countries have said about Atatürk in the past? Since Atatürk started his military career, many country presidents, prime ministers, important people, and even the people of those countries have talked about Atatürk’s success many times. There are more than 60 countries mentioned here. He may have fought with only 20 of them, or perhaps he only spoke with 20 of them, but Atatürk was such a person — a successful, hardworking, and wonderful leader whose name was known around the world.

Quotes from the USA:

President Franklin D. Roosevelt said that “Atatürk is one of the greatest men of our time.”

In fact, among these three countries, there are different countries, some of which we have defeated, some of which we have lost, some of which we have fought a lot against, but the common point of all of them is that Atatürk is about how good, how great, how successful, how peaceful a leader he was.

Quotes from Azerbaijan:

Mehmet Emin Resulzade said that “Atatürk is the greatest leader of the Turkish world.”

None of these people commemorate just one leader; we follow the traces of a life that sheds light on the rebirth of a nation, bringing hope to darkness and courage to despair. The legacy Atatürk left us is a future written not with bullets, but with reason, science, hard work, and the belief in freedom. On every November 10th, we rise again with his eternal ideas, and with the gratitude we carry in our hearts we promise once again. As we walk in your footsteps, we seem to hear your voice; you practically say, “My greatest work is the Republic.”
