Every 29th of October, we celebrate not just the birth of a nation, but the awakening of its spirit. The Republic is more than a political change; it is a promise of freedom, equality, and knowledge. When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk founded the Republic in 1923, he gave us more than independence. He gave us belief in education, in science, and in ourselves. As a student, I feel that belief every day. Each lesson I take, every question I ask, and every dream I chase is a reflection of that vision.

Sometimes I wonder what it must have felt like back then: a young nation, rebuilding from ashes yet filled with hope. Atatürk's words, "The future belongs to the youth," were not just an encouragement; they were a responsibility. To me, the Republic means courage—the courage to think freely, to speak the truth, to change the world through learning. It reminds me that true independence doesn't end with war; it begins with ideas. If I could write a letter to Atatürk, I would tell him: "Your Republic is alive. We still carry your light. We learn, we dream, and we build—just like you taught us. Your hope for the future lives within us." The Republic began with a dream—and that dream continues to shine in every classroom, in every young heart, and in the bright future we are creating together.
