While you see a sun shining in the sky every 29th of October, you also see how your ancestors' ideas changed the world you live in. On every Republic Day, our nation is reborn. Not so surprisingly, the leader of this revolution was once a student like you. He sat on a wooden desk waiting for the math class to end so that he could go home and rest. He played and argued with his friends every day. Therefore, we can't say that we are very different from him, can we?

Atatürk's legacy may feel simple for us in this highly developing world. However, a hundred years ago, it was revolutionary to suggest that everyone should vote. It was even crazier to say that women can wear pants! While people looked at the world through blinders, he took them off and opened a window.

He industrialized Türkiye while focusing on agriculture, politics, human rights, and keeping the economy in stable condition. These ideas are blessings to us and teenagers are using them all the time: while going to school, deciding what to wear, what to read or write about, or while choosing a career.

He built a country's future with dreams, just like how we are building our own future in our minds. His being determined, disciplined, courageous, a visionary, and a humanist affected us 100 years later. It is our job to follow in his footsteps with the free spirit gifted to us. Moreover, teens and Atatürk share many personality traits in common. Realizing this would really help some stressed and lost teens in their 'golden' years.

So, all I am saying is that you are the main character, the leader in your story. All thanks to some heroes who, just like you, weren't afraid to talk.
